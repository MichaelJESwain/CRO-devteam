# HYPOTHESIS
Because we have learned from TH122 that adding XO widget on GLP has in general reduced the PLP visits but increased PDP visits, but it has improved conversion rate for visitors that come back from PLP/PDP, which means the XO widget has been changing their journey to PLP thus the exploration. We expect that allowing visitors to continue their journey to explore the list of XO widget on GLP through providing a link to the relevant PLP will further improve add to bag and conversion.
