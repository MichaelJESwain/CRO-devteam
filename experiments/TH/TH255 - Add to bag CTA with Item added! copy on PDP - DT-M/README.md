# HYPOTHESIS
Follow up test of CK276 - Validate 'Add another' CTA Taking into consideration new set up of PDP and add to bag CTAs, we are looking to re test on both brands CK/TH to confirm positive results before implementing. 

Because we've learned that few visitors interacted with the 'add another' CTA (previous set up onsite) and seems to offer little added value, we expect that by having the Add to bag copy (Current set up onsite) and changing copy to item added once user adds products to cart,  will lead to lowered feelings of uncertainty, resulting in a higher CVR.


## Variant 0 - Control
Current live site

## Variant 1 
Visual changes:  
Check the design, link 
Functional changes:  
User adds item to bag
Call to add  the item, show spinner
Positive feedback on the button  and mini shopping bag show up. Button is "disabled", clicking on it does nothing. The copy of the button changes to "Item added!".
Mini shopping bag disappears, button gets back to "normal". It is active again.
