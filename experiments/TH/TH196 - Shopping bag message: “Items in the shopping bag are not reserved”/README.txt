HYPOTHESIS
Similar as previous message, we expect showing that “Items in the shopping bag are 
not reserved” creates the urgency for them to check out before it’s stock-out, so it 
decreases Cart Abandonment Rate and increase Conversion Rate.


Variant 1 - Alert with message in the top of the page
Alert with icon and text "Items in the shopping bag are not reserved.", under the 
Shopping Bag's page title
On DESKTOP, the alert's width is FLEXIBLE. It adapts to the text length, meaning 
that the text does NOT break in two lines.
On MOBILE, the alert's width takes the columns' full width.

Variant 2 - Alert with message under the product list
Alert with icon and text "Items in the shopping bag are not reserved."
Placement: under the product list
On DESKTOP, the alert's width is FLEXIBLE. It adapts to the text length, meaning 
that the text does NOT break in two lines.
