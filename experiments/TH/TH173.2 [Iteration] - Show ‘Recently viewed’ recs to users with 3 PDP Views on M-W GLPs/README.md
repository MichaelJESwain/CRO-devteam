# HYPOTHESIS
We have learned from previous test (TH122) that showing recommended products on the GLP increases the number of visitors that reach a PDP and add items to their Cart, with a higher CVR for GLP visitors coming from a PLP/PDP. We expect that showing also the recently viewed products on GLP to users who have viewed at least 3 PDPs will increase their engagement, keeping them in the journey and ultimately improve A2B, PDP Views per Visit and overall CVR.

## Variant 0 - Control
No changes

## Variant 1 
Visual changes: show the Recently viewed module in alternative to the Recommended for you one (or Sale trending, or Summer holidays, etc.) in the same spot on Women & Men GLPs

## Variant 2
Visual changes: show the Recently viewed module together with the Recommended for you one (or Sale trending, or Summer holidays, etc.). The Recently viewed module is on top of the other one (& a Content spot in between the two recs modules, as in figma)
