# HYPOTHESIS
Because we learned that visitors (in NL & PL) trigger an error message in Checkout Payment, we expect that prompting them to select their bank from the Ideal (NL) and Dotpay (in PL) dropdown menus will support a frictionless checkout experience and result in an uplift on CVR. 

## Variant 0 - Control
No changes

## Variant 1 
Add a (red) copy box above the 'Select your bank' dropdown menu to remind users of selecting their bank in case they chose Ideal or Dotpay as a payment method
