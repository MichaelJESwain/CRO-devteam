# HYPOTHESIS
Because we assume that when users land on PDP they are interested in the product details and description, we want to focus on the redesign of the accordions, in order to display them (and the info included in each) in the best possible way, according to market standards and best practices. By hiding the flavored copy paragraph for TH PDPs, we expect to de-clutter the 'Details' section and only provide key info about the product itself (Highlights, Size & fit, Composition & care) and to assess the impact of product info/copy on A2B. This way, we also improve the visibility of widget 2 (Recommended for you), which we know is highly converting. By doing so, we expect that the bounce rate upon landing decreases and to ultimately improve A2B and CVR.

## Variant 0 - Control
No changes

## Variant 1 
Hide copy above 'Highlights' paragraph in 'Details' accordion on all TH PDP
