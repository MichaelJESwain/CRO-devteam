# HYPOTHESIS
Because we know that users cannot always find an alternative to a product that is sold out in one or more sizes, we want to increase the visibility and relevancy of the PDP widget 1 pushing similar products. In fact, if the product is part of a campaign/capsule/exclusive and is sold out in one or more sizes, it will never be replenished, thus there will be no 'Notify me' functionality enabled on FE. This means that the consumer coming to the website for that specific product has no reason to stay on and continue his journey as no alternatives are presented to him immediately.

We expect that by adding a copy msg that informs the user that we have similar products to the sold out one (and in the desired size), users will engage with this message and check out the widget 1 recs on PDPs, which recommends similar products based on the image-encoder algorithm. 

This should increase Add2Bag as well as improving overall CVR.
