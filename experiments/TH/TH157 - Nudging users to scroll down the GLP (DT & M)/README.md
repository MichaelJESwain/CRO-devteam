# HYPOTHESIS
Because we learned that only 30% of the content on GLP is seen by users and that users who scroll show promising results we expect by displaying indicators to show where users are in terms of content consumption on the page will nudge users to scroll down and therefore increase PLP visits (discoverability) and ultimately positively impact the revenue metrics.
