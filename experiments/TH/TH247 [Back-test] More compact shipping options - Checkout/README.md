# HYPOTHESIS
We knew that users spend a relatively long amount of time on the shipping selector when we compare to other page elements. By back-testing the compact shipping options with the "Pick-up" tab we expect to see that they lead to an increase in conversion due to reducing the cognitive effort for users by restructuring the information hierarchy. 

## Variant 0 - Control
Current Site - The compact Shipping options with the "Pick-up" tab

## Variant 1 
Previous version - The shipping options containing copy and without the "Pick-Up" tab (see screenshots below).
