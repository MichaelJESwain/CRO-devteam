# HYPOTHESIS
Because we know that the CVC code error is triggered often, we expect applying a tooltip with information on where to find the code will increase fulfilment ease. By making this clear for users, we expect it to reduce the error rate that is experienced on the Payments page, leading to less users experiencing friction and an uplift in CVR.
