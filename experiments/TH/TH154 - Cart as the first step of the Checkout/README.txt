# TH154 - Cart as the first step of the Checkout

## HYPOTHESIS

Because we learned that we have a drop off of 58% between Cart and Checkout we 
expect that by displaying the Cart as first step of the Checkout will nudge users 
to finalize their tasks and therefore increase visits on Checkout and ultimately 
the CVR.

### Control:
Checkout pages as they are.

### Variant 1:
On DT and M, add Cart as first step of the checkout. (see Sezane or Bash examples) 
Adding the step "Cart" within the progress bar that is already existing in checkout 
(currently it's 3 steps).
So it would be: Cart > Details > Delivery > Payment
Display this progress bar with Cart as first step in the Cart page as well 
Change the main CTA copy from "Start Checkout" to "Checkout" or "Order" â†’ Mitchell 
recommends testing this separately.
