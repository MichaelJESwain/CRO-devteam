# HYPOTHESIS
FBecause we learned that many visitors will not click on the 'notify me' CTA, we expect that by presenting a clear design of the size selector and motivating visitors to click through, we will increase the throughflow to the out of stock subscription form. This will result in additional out of stock subscriptions.


## Variant 0 - Control
When a OOS size is selected, CTA changes to Notify Me
Click/tap triggers a pop up with an email field

## Variant 1 
Same as V0, but with an additional message before the CTA
"This item is currently out of stock. Click the link below to be notified when it becomes available."
Pop opens same as V0, no change in it

## Variant 2
Same as V1, but when a size is selected, the email field already exposed
"This size is currently out of stock, but don’t worry! Enter your email address below and we’ll notify you when it becomes available again."
No pop-up
Success message after email input: "Thank you! We will email you when the item is back in stock."
Success message disappears once user selects another size or refreshes the page
