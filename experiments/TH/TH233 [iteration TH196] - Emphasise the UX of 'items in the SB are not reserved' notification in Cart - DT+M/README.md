# HYPOTHESIS
Because we've seen that visitors indicate that items in the shopping bag are removed too quickly, we expect that by emphasizing that the "items in bag are not reserved" with a notification, we will create a sense of urgency and increasing the chance of not missing out on their chosen products. This will increase Checkout rate and CVR.
