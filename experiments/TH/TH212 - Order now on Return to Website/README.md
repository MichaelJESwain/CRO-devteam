# HYPOTHESIS
Because we learned that returning users who immediately go back to items they've left in their cart convert better than returning users who start browsing the website, we expect that reminding users of items they've previously shown interest in directly after they land will lead to an uplift on CVR for returning visitors.

## Variant 0 - Control
No changes

## Variant 1 
When a returning user has one or more items in their Shopping Bag, the toast component appears on the first page they land.
The component includes a thumbnail image of the first item in their SB, a copy, a CTA (link style), and a close button.
On Mobile the component slides up from the bottom, and from the right-hand side on Desktop.
User can remove the component by clicking on the 'X' button. Otherwise, the component stays visible until the user goes to the next page.
Copy: 
Title: Hi, you left something in your bag
CTA: View shopping bag
