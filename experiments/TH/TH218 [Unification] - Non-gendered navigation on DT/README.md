# HYPOTHESIS
By removing the category dropdown of non-gendered menu bar (Women, Men, Kids, Tommy Jeans, Tommy Stories) by hover on the relevant pages when no gender has been selected, we want to understand the impact of the non-gendered category entries. Meanwhile, also testing the impact of removing the Tommy Jeans and Tommy Stories entry. The test is to decide on the final unified version of the navigation. We want to see if removing them would negatively impact the discovery process and ultimately the A2B, and CVR.

## Variant 0 - Control
Current TH non gendered navigation menu (like the menu on the Splash page: Women, Men, Kids, Tommy Jeans, Tommy Stories + dropdown with categories )

## Variant 1 
Remove the dropdown with categories of the non gendered menubar, but keep the menubar itself (Women, Men, Kids, Tommy Jeans, Tommy Stories stays but no dropdown when hovering) 

## Variant 2
Only display Gender (Women, Men, Kids) entries (remove all category dropdown, entry for Tommy Jeans and Tommy stories) for Splash page, Search result page, Tommy Jeans page.
