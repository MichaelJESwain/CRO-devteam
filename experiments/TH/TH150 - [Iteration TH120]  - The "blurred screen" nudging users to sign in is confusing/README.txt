HYPOTHESIS
Because we learn that the blurred screen on wishlist disrupts the user's journey 
by increasing exit from this page but also nudge users to sign in/register we 
expect that by proposing free access to wishlist with clear CTA and an explanation 
of why users have to sign in/register we will soothe the friction on the journey 
and increase wishlist usage but still nudge users to sign in.

Variant 0 - Control

Variant 1 
No Blurred screen
Below the part with the two CTAs “Continue shopping” and “View shopping bag” and 
above the grid presenting all the favourites items:
 Add another part that is distinct by a coloured backgrounded (aligned with brand 
 guidelines) and in which we highlight two CTAs (if possible centred within the 
 part) “Sign-in” “create an account”
  Still in this part of the page, add below the two CTAs the copy to clearly 
  explain to users the value to sign-in or register to access the wishlist: “Sign 
  in or register to save your wishlist and view it on all your devices. We now 
  temporarily save your wishlist and only in this browser.” 

Variant 2
Same as V1 but without CTAs
