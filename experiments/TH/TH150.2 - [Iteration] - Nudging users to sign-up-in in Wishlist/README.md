# HYPOTHESIS
We know that after removing the blurred screen on Wishlist in TH150 [iteration TH120]  - Remove "blurred screen" to nudge users to register/sign-in & Add WL benefits - DT+M, we had an increase in activity on Wishlist. However, we see a decline in sign-ins/ups, even when we display a CTA and an explanation of the associated benefits. By nudging users to sign-in/up by making the account creation's benefits more clear we will increase Wishlist usage but also improve sign-ins/ups.
