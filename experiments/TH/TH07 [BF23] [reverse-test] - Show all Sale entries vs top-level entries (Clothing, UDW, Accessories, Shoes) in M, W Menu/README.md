# HYPOTHESIS
To improve discoverability of the Black Friday catalogue & facilitate the user journey, we want to show in the Menu all the children categories of Sale Clothing (Sale Coats & Jackets, Sale Sweats & Knitwear, Sale Dresses & skirts, Sale Tops, Sale Jeans, Sale Trousers & Shorts) vs only showing the “top-level” categories (Sale Clothing, Sale UDW & SMW, Sale Bags & Accessories, Sale Shoes). We expect our users to waste less time in finding what they are looking for (also by using filters on a broader selection of products), ultimately improving their discovery journey. As a result, we hope to increase Sale PLP Views & overall CVR during Sale.

## Variant 0 - Control
Current Menu on live site displaying top-level Sale categories only (Sale Clothing, Sale UDW & Swim, Sale Bags & Accessories, Sale Shoes)

## Variant 1 - TH design & CK copy (free returns USP only)
Display also all children categories of Sale Clothing (above)
