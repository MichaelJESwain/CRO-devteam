HYPOTHESIS
Because we know that our customers have some expectations in terms of convenience and service 
and that part of our customers are struggling to find answers to their questions we expect by 
making FAQ content easily accessible from the header throughout the site will positively impact 
the journey progress and ultimately increase the CVR.


V1:
Display in the header a “FAQ” CTA
When clicking on the CTA the FAQ page slides in (see the example in the 1st screenshot) and displays the FAQ content (see screenshot to see the scope of the content we want to display).
when clicking on the topic the content (lvl2 information) is still displayed within the slide.
V2:
The same variant as V1 but a different copy for the CTA: “Assistance”

V3:
The same variant as V1 but a different copy for the CTA: “Help”

V4: 
The same variant as V1 but a different copy for the CTA: “Help Center”
