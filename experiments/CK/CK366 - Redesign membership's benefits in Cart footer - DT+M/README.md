# HYPOTHESIS
Because we learned that users react positively to us displaying more information about the membership's benefits lower down the funnel (Cart, Checkout), we expect that by further highlighting these benefits in the Cart's footer we will encourage users to sign-up and proceed to Checkout.

## Variant 0 - Control
Current Site 

## Variant 1 
Getting rid of the img + Putting emphasis on highlighting the benefits.Visual changes:

Moving the benefits + icons above the email field & the 'Subscribe' CTA

Removing the headline above the benefits + icons

Removing the image in the Footer's banner

Overall banner size is smaller and more balanced

Functional changes: Behavior is the same as on the live version

1st screen – Default view

2nd screen – When users start interacting with the input field we expand the checkmarks with gender 
preferences and T&C

3rd screen – After users fill the email field and checkmarks, we show the "Thank you" message
