# HYPOTHESIS
Because we've learned from TH191/TH196 that indicating that items in Cart are not reserved, motivates visitors to place an order, we expect that showing this notification on CK as well, will create a sense of urgency and increasing the chance of not missing out on the selected products. This will increase CVR.

## Variant 0 - Control
Current website

## Variant 1 - Alert with message in the top of the page
Alert with icon and text "Items in the shopping bag are not reserved.", under the Shopping Bag's page title
On DESKTOP, the alert's width is FLEXIBLE. It adapts to the text length, meaning that the text does NOT break in two lines.
On MOBILE, the alert's width takes the columns' full width.

## Variant 2 - Alert with message under the product list
Alert with icon and text "Items in the shopping bag are not reserved."
Placement: under the product list
On DESKTOP, the alert's width is FLEXIBLE. It adapts to the text length, meaning that the text does NOT break in two lines.
