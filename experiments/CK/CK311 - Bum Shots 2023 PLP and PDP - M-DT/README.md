# HYPOTHESIS
Because we saw a significant increase in sales across the board with Bum shots, 
we expect that by testing adding the SP23 bum shots on PLPs first image vs the standard flat lay shot + the leading image on the PDP , will lead to an increase of Add to cart % and enhance of the user journey.


## Variant 0
Visual changes: show current order of images on PLP / PDP (bum shot in first position, flat product image in second postion)

## Variant 1
Visual changes: Switch the order of the first and second image on PLP / PDP (flat product image in first position, bum shot in second position)
