# HYPOTHESIS
Because we learnt from previous experiments (CK224 - Order now on Return to Website, TH212 - 'Order now' upon return to website & CK224.2 / TH182 [Iteration] - Increase prominence of 'items-in-cart' reminder in Header - DT+M) that returning users who go back to the website like being reminded of the items they’ve left in the Cart and generally convert better than returning users who start browsing the website "from scratch", we expect that by further improving the UX/UI of the ‘items-in-cart’ reminder and making the product tile clickable in the Header we will cause an uplift in overall CVR.

## Variant 0 - Control
No changes

## Variant 1 
Make product tile in Header pop-up clickable so that users can go back to PDP from the 'items-in-cart' reminder directly. No visual changes
