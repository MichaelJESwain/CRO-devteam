HYPOTHESIS
Because we've learned that few visitors interact with the 'add another' CTA and seems to offer little 
added value, we expect that by [change copy ] will lead to lowered feelings of uncertainty, resulting in a higher CVR.


Variant 1 - Green checkmark
see V1 only, but keep secondary "proceed to checkout" CTA in there (only look at green checkmark animation)
- Visual changes: Main CTA becomes green with checkmark (positive feedback), keep secondary CTA as-is
- Mobile specific: apply the green checkmark to one of the buttons inside of the add-to-bag popup, replace for 'view shopping bag' CTA. 
Functional changes: 
- Clicking on green CTA has no functionality
- Desktop only: Show animation/green CTA for 5 seconds and change back to normal "add to bag" CTA after 
- Copy changes: change copy to "Item Added" â†’ translations attached

Variant 2 - "Add to Bag" instead of "Add Another"
- Change copy of "add another" CTA to "Add to Bag"
