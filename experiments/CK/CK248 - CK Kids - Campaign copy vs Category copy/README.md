# HYPOTHESIS
Because we think that users do not understand where they'll end up if they click on a campaign CTA, we expect that having the copy reflect the product category that users are clicking on will help users find campaign products and therefore increase CTR to the campaigns.

## Variant 0 - Control
No changes

## Variant 1 
Design considerations: As you can see from the screenshot attached, at the moment we are adopting a type of campaign copy that does not communicate clearly what our consumer will find in the PLP when clicking on a specific image/CTA. The idea is to test:  i.e. Control: Sporty Swim vs Variant 1: Swimwear. 
Detailed specification of all aspects of the change:
Visual changes: -
Functional changes: -
Copy changes: 
Change copy "Sporty Swim" → "Swimwear"
Change copy "Jump in" → "Shoes"
Change copy "Modern Basics" → "Underwear"
