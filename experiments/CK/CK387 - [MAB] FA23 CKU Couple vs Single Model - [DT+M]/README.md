# HYPOTHESIS
Considering the budgetary limitations, Content often opts for using flat lay imagery or single model assets over the more expensive model imagery. To research the potential effects on business outcomes, we intend to test for the CKU Multipacks Campaign. Our objective is to explore whether displaying couple model imagery, rather than single imagery, can generate a favorable increase in both Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR).

## Variant 0 - Control
Single model

## Variant 1 
Couple images - Visual changes:  Display the Couple image (instead of single model image) in the Multipacks module of the M | W GLP
