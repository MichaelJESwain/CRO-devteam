# HYPOTHESIS
Because we know that the swipe functionality embedded in XO widgets on PDPs is not heavily used, thus users tend not to scroll left/right the recommended products, but at the same time we also know that the XO widgets on PDP are highly converting elements, we want to test a grid view widget to display at least 4 products in PDP widget 2 (on Mobile), currently displaying "Recommended for you" products. By improving the visibility (and the number) of recommended products in XO widget 2, we expect to generate higher PDP Views per Visit, higher A2B and ultimately improve CVR. 

## Variant 0 - Control
Control

## Variant 1 -  Display product recs in grid view WITH A2B buttons + 'Load more' button
Visual changes:  a grid of 4 products with A2B buttons +  load more button

Functional changes:  when clicking/tapping on load more show up to 8 products

Translations: 'Load more' to be translated for Big6

## Variant 2 -  Display product recs in grid view WITHOUT A2B buttons + 'Load more' button
Visual changes:  grid of 4 products without A2B buttons  +  load more button

Functional changes:  when clicking/tapping on load more show up to 8 products

Translations: 'Load more' to be translated for Big6
