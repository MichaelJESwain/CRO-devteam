# HYPOTHESIS
Because we know that USPs have a huge impact on decision-making process and therefore help users to take the next step we expect that by making USPs more easily scannable on the cart (TH set-up = title + icons) will support and motivate users to make a buying decision and help mitigate concerns. This should positively impact the checkout funnel and ultimately the CVR.

## Variant 0 - Control
Control: CK set up => Design USPs = only text

## Variant 1 
TH set up => Design USPs = Text + icon + light background
