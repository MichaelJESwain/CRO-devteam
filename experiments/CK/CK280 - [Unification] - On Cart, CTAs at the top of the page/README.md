# HYPOTHESIS
We expect that adding CTAs "Continue shopping" or "Start checkout" at the top of the cart page will motivate users to continue their exploration if they still need time to make a decision, or nudge them to start the checkout. This should positively impact the journey by reducing exit from this page and ultimately positively impact the checkout funnel and ultimately the CVR.
