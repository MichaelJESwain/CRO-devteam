# HYPOTHESIS
We know that users consistently drop from our website between the Payment page and the Order Confirmation page. We also know that users tend to spend a long time considering which payment option they will most likely use. By making the payment information more compact, we expected users to spend less time on the Payment page thanks to the reduced cognitive effort caused by the removal of the unnecessary noise. By reverse-testing the compact payment options in Checkout we expect to see an increase in conversion. 


## Variant 0 - Control
Current live site - Reduced payment information

## Variant 1 
The previous version of the Payments page - without the compact options
