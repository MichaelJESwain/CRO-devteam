# HYPOTHESIS
As a result of two successful tests, we have implemented the total discount/savings msg & calculation in Cart. During BF, we want to test a different UX for the msg in order to further improve the overall Checkout experience and clearly communicate to our users how much they're saving on each purchase. We expect to improve Checkout rate & overall CVR.
