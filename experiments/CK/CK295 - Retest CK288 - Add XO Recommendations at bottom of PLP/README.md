# HYPOTHESIS
Because we know that 'dead ends' at the bottom of the PLP loop users out of their browsing flow and cause user frustration, we expect that adding product recommendations at the bottom of the PLP will increase their ability to navigate, leading to an uplift on add-to-bag rate and AOV.

## Variant 0 - Control
Show recommendations at bottom of PLP

## Variant 1 
Hide Recently Viewed Product Recommendations at the bottom of PLP
