HYPOTHESIS
Because we know that users go to GLP to navigate back to lower page funnels (PLP) and that 30% of our 
visitors want to see underwear products, we expect by showing the recommended for you module on GLP  will 
facilitate the discovery process and this will increase PDP visits, add-to-bag, and conversion metrics.


Variant 1
- Recommendation module based on campaign
- Displaying right after the Module 1
- Add “Shop Collection” pointing to GLP on the right
>> remove add to bag CTA (different to design)
