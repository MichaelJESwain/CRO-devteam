# HYPOTHESIS
Because we've learned from user testing that people value product imagery while they are choosing their size, we expect that by having the imagery clearly visible while interacting with the size selector, we can increase the fluency of the process, resulting in a higher A2B rate

## Variant 0 - Control
No changes

## Variant 1 
Remove the grey overlay. Only runs on DT (as mobile is too small - See other test with image in Size Selector header)
